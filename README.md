# Stock-and-Crypto-Trader

This is a simple bot that uses the [Alpaca API](https://alpaca.markets/) to trade stocks and crypto. It uses a PPO (Proximal Policy Opitmization), A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic), and DQN (Deep Q-Network) to make trades. It also uses a simple moving average to determine when to buy and sell. The bot is currently set to trade on the SPY ETF, but can be easily changed to trade on any stock or crypto.

This is a trading bot for stock and crypto markets, built with Python and Flask. The bot uses machine learning algorithms to predict future stock and crypto prices, and then makes trades based on those predictions. The Flask application provides a web interface for users to configure the bot and view its performance.

## Installation

To install and run the trading bot, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Configure your API keys for the stock and crypto exchanges you want to trade on, as well as your machine learning models.
Start the Flask application by running python app.py.
Visit http://localhost:5000 in your web browser to access the trading bot web interface.

## Configuration

The trading bot can be configured through the web interface, which provides a form for users to input their desired settings. These settings include:

Stock and crypto exchange API keys: You will need to obtain API keys from the exchanges you want to trade on and enter them in the appropriate fields.
Machine learning model selection: The bot supports several machine learning models for predicting future prices, including linear regression, neural networks, and time series analysis. Users can select their desired model from a dropdown menu.
Trading parameters: Users can set various trading parameters, such as the amount of funds to allocate for trading, the minimum price change required to trigger a trade, and the stop-loss and take-profit levels for trades.

## Usage

To use the trading bot, follow these steps:

Configure the bot using the web interface.
Start the bot by clicking the "Start Trading" button.
Monitor the bot's performance on the web interface, which displays real-time updates on the bot's trades and profits.
